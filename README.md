Our Find Your Food project builds a comprehensive and easily accessible ontology about food, recipes, ingredients, restaurants as well as the diets, menus, seasons and occasions users may be suitable for. 

FoodOn is initially based on a conversion of the LanguaL.org food indexing thesaurus, integrated with OBOFoundry ontology terms from UBERON, ChEBI, and NCBITaxon and others.
